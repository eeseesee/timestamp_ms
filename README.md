#Timestamp Microservice

A full stack JavaScript app built using Node.js, and Express, with Bootstrap for the (minimal!) front end, that fulfills the following user stories:

1. User Story: I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

2. User Story: If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

3. User Story: If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

Built for the Timestamp Microservice API Project at Free Code Camp.

A running version of the app can be found at http://ecc-timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/
